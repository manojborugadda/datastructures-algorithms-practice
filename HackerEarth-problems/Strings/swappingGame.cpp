/**
Sherlock and Watson are playing swapping game. Watson gives to Sherlock a string S on which he has performed K swaps. You need to help Sherlock in finding the original string.
One swap on a string is performed in this way:

Assuming 1 indexing, the i'th letter from the end is inserted between i'th and (i+1)'th letter from the starting.
For example, we have "contest". After one swap, it would change to "ctosnet"

Input:
First line contains K, the number of swaps performed by Watson. Next line contains S, the string Watson gives to Sherlock.

Output:
You have to print in one line the original string with which Watson had started.

Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ 109
3 ≤ Length(S) ≤ 1000
All characters in S will be small English alphabets.
